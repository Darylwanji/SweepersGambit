**Prompt for AI:**  

I am building a futuristic-themed main menu for my game called **Sweeper's Gambit**, inspired by the following reference image:  
*Description of the reference image*:  
- A sleek and modern menu with a dark blue gradient background transitioning to a lighter blue tone.  
- The title "Sweeper's Gambit" is prominently displayed in large, futuristic text with a glowing effect.  
- Below the title is a subtitle: "Choose your challenge," written in smaller, simple, and modern text.  
- The menu contains large, evenly spaced buttons for:  
  1. Minesweeper  
  2. Chess vs AI  
  3. Controls  
  4. Quit  
- Each button is rectangular with rounded edges and includes an icon representing its function.  
- At the bottom, there is a dropdown menu labeled "Theme" with a futuristic style.  
- A moon icon in the top-right corner suggests a toggle for light/dark mode.  

### **Requirements for the Menu**  

1. **General Styling**:  
   - Use a dark blue gradient background with smooth transitions.  
   - Ensure the title "Sweeper's Gambit" is displayed in a large, glowing futuristic font with a neon effect.  
   - Use consistent font styles for buttons and subtitles to match the futuristic theme.  

2. **Button Animations**:  
   - Buttons should have futuristic hover and click animations:  
     - On hover, buttons should glow or have a ripple effect.  
     - On click, include a smooth shrinking/expanding animation or a subtle particle effect around the button.  
   - Add relevant icons inside the buttons (e.g., a grid for Minesweeper, a calendar for Chess vs AI, etc.).  

3. **Theme Dropdown**:  
   - The theme dropdown should blend with the futuristic theme and have smooth opening/closing animations.  
   - Add a glowing border when selected.  

4. **Dark Mode Toggle**:  
   - Include a moon icon in the top-right corner that toggles light/dark mode when clicked.  
   - Light mode should have a white-to-light-blue gradient background while preserving the futuristic style.  

5. **Consistency Across the Project**:  
   - Ensure the visual style, fonts, and animations are consistent across all game screens (e.g., gameplay screens, leaderboards, and settings).  
   - All UI components, such as buttons, icons, and dropdowns, should follow the same futuristic theme and animation logic.  
   - Use reusable styles and animations through CSS classes or shared JavaScript logic to maintain uniformity.  

6. **Responsive Design**:  
   - The menu should be fully responsive, maintaining its design on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  

7. **Code Requirements**:  
   - Provide the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to implement this menu.  
   - Ensure clean, reusable, and well-commented code for future modifications.  
   - Use modular code practices to allow easy application of the menu's design elements to other parts of the project.  

### Additional Notes  
- Focus heavily on visual appeal and smooth animations for all interactive elements.  
- Ensure all icons and text are centered and aligned properly within their respective containers.  
- Consistency in style is crucialâ€”this menu should set the standard for the rest of the game's UI.
